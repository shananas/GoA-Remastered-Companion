# GoA-Remastered-Companion

Provides the remastered assets the GoA need to function properly for those who do not have the space to extract the remastered assets.

Note: If you do not extract the remastered files and use this mod instead when doing `Build and Run` or `Build Only` when mod manager is `Building KH2FM-Mods-Num/GoA-ROM-Edition for PC` you will see a lot of Warnings. These can be ignored as this mod will provide these files when it is Building
